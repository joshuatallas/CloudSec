# About This Project

This project is part of the CloudSec initiative, providing a RESTful API for managing policy data in a PostgreSQLdatabase. It allows for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting policies with various attributes such as tenant, subject, action, and more.

CloudSec (cloudsecpy on PyPI) is a library and toolkit for formally analyzing security policies in cloud and API systems using Python. It has a modular and extensible architecture allowing it to support multiple backends; currently, z3 and cvc5 are supported, but more backends will be supported in the future. The CloudSec project takes influence from a number of related projects, such as the Z3 Firewall Checker.
